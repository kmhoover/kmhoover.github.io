			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">My Main Tasks:</h2>
			<div class ="row">
				<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				<p>I worked for the Cyber Security team under the CISO tasked with making eSentire a more secure company. In order to do this, I had to know how each team operates, what tools they use, and how well they respond to cyber awareness training.<br>My job consisted of working with program managers and system administrators. When I was helping the program managers, I had to use my verbal communication skills to run meetings and get all the necessary information. After the meetings, I had to use my written communication skills to summarize the notes I made throughout the meeting and report it to the Program Managers. When I was helping the System Administrators, I had to use my technical skills to learn the tools they use to create and maintain groups of employees so that it is easy to allow them access to the different applications they need.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">Business Continuity Management Program:</h2>
			<p>Business Continuity Management Programs are the planning that an organization goes through to maintain business functions and recover after a disaster has occured. I was assigned the task of completing Business Impact Analysis Activities with each department. To complete this, I had to book several meetings with each department lead to define all of their processes and assets they used to complete their processes. We would also discuss where they would go for help if they were unable to use their assets. This information will allow us to create remediation plans in case a disaster occurs.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">Azure Active Directory:</h2>
			<p>To allow easy access for employees to download all tools they need to do their daily tasks, we created groups on Azure Active Directory. In order to do this, I had to go through every employee and group them by their role / department. After this was done on paper, I created a powershell script that created a group on Azure AD and assigned the correct employees to that group. On top of providing easy access for employees to download the correct tools, it will also prevent Shadow IT and we will know what tools each employee has downloaded.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">Cyber Awareness Training:</h2>
			<p>At the start of my co-op term I was assigned the task of summarizing the feedback of eSentire’s cyber awareness program. Throughout my work term, I would assist in fulfilling some of the suggestions/feedback that I summarized. The most common feedback that we received was that employees loved the interactive training and quizzes throughout the training.<br>I did some research and found a tool called iSpring that is an add-on to powerpoint and allows you to create interactive quizzes that control the flow of the content. I created multiple quizzes that mimic the phishing campaigns and ask the user what they should’ve caught in the phishing message. If an employee falls for one of our phishing campaigns, they will be assigned the appropriate quiz and hopefully they use what they learned and not fall for a phishing email again.<p>

			            <p>This goal was to become comfortable using Powershell to interact with Azure Active Directory. My measure of success would be my ability to complete all assigned tasks on my own and solve the problems efficiently. At the end of the term I wasn’t only just able to solve all Azure AD and Powershell problems on my own, but I also learned iSpring Suite and taught it to my co-workers who will continue to use it once I am gone.</p>
