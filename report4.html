			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">My Main Tasks:</h2>
			<div class ="row">
				<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				<p>Arctic Wolf provides a 24/7 cyber security monitoring plan. This is facilitated through a Security Operations Centre (SOC). Numerous teams are involved in creating tools and scripts to enhance the SOC's efficiency in detecting threats. My team focused on improving the efficiency of identifying network threats. This involved tasks such as identifying malicious ports, blocking specific IP addresses, and testing firewalls.<br><br>I worked on a wide variety of tickets that involved researching threats and threat actors, writing scripts to detect specific events, determining the severity of incidents, creating new rules based on client requests, and working on an individual project to extract ransomware information from the Threat Intel Platform. This information was used to assist in training an AI model for better ransomware classification.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">Research and Triaging:</h2>
			<p>A significant part of my job involved researching threats and threat actors, and determining whether events posed a security threat. I found great satisfaction in researching threats and gaining insights into how threat actors targeted various companies. Subsequently, I leveraged the knowledge I acquired to better classify network traffic as either malicious or benign. By the end of my term, I had amassed a toolkit of various tools to aid in this process. I regularly utilized the Sputnik Chrome extension to search for information related to IPs, domains, file hashes, and URLs. Furthermore, I developed a deep understanding of Snort/Suricata rules and the conditions that caused them to trigger.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">Adding Configurations:</h2>
			<p>Another integral aspect of my role involved handling client requests and formulating corresponding rules. When clients expressed preferences for receiving alerts on specific threats or were content with not receiving alerts for certain web traffic, my responsibility was to first validate the request for its feasibility and then appropriately escalate the relevant events. To accomplish this, I would either create a new .yaml file or add to an existing one, and subsequently construct a .json object to facilitate the event escalation process.</p>
            <h2 style="color:#1434A4">Ransomware Classifier:</h2>
			<p>At the start of my co-op, I received a ticket to validate an AI's classification of events to determine whether they constituted ransomware threats. To accomplish this, I meticulously reviewed a file containing 3,000 .json objects, manually verifying and updating the AI's assessments. During this process, I developed a script to streamline this task, significantly improving efficiency for future validations.<br>About a month later, I became acquainted with the Threat Intel Platform, which offers extensive threat classification information, such as Adware, Worm, Trojan, Ransomware, and more. To leverage this resource, I designed a Python script to extract this information. When a threat was classified as ransomware, I appended its description to a list that could later serve to corroborate the AI's predictions. Arctic Wolf intends to utilize my script for its intended purpose in the future. Moreover, as the first to extract information from this platform, I also imparted this knowledge to my team, and they have plans to extract more information in the future!</p>

			            <p>My primary objective was to advance my Python skills through hands-on involvement in real-time cybersecurity projects. I aimed to delve into commonly utilized libraries and dedicate ample time to honing my skills through practical applications. Although I didn't engage in as much programming as initially anticipated, I managed to carve out time to develop a Python script designed to query a Threat Intel Platform. This script plays a pivotal role in augmenting an AI model's capacity to distinguish ransomware threats. The positive feedback I received was immensely gratifying, and I'm excited to know that my tool will continue to be utilized in future endeavors. This experience also marked my time querying an API, making it an invaluable learning opportunity.</p>
