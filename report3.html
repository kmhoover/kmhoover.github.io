				<p>eSentire sells a sensor that continuously monitors clients' networks for threats. The sensor reports all information to the Security Operations Centre and blocks traffic that violates a rule. As a Quality Assurance Developer, I was responsible for testing this sensor. I developed a test suite from scratch that replicated each event triggering an alert and verified that the correct rule generated the alert.<br><br>Moreover, I collaborated with the Sensor team to identify and report any issues or bugs found during the testing process. This co-op placement gave me a better understanding of the importance of quality assurance in the cybersecurity industry and the challenges involved in developing and testing complex systems. Additionally, I gained valuable connections in the industry and hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies that will benefit me in my future career.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">Test Automation:</h2>
			<p>One of the primary obstacles I encountered was automating the test suite. To accomplish this, I needed to log in to the sensor, execute a script that breached one of the security rules, and then validate that the proper alert was generated without requiring any user intervention. I found this to be an exciting challenge, as it provided me with a deeper understanding of shell scripting and allowed me to automate commands using a Python script.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#1434A4">Sensor Rules:</h2>
			<p>I tested both Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). To carry out these tests, I had to evaluate the rules that the sensor used to either report suspicious network traffic or block malicious network traffic. To create automated tests for these rules, I needed a comprehensive understanding of how the sensor operated and the specific rules that were in place. Through this experience, I gained valuable expertise in network security and the intricacies involved in testing and validating IDS/IPS systems.</p>

			            <p>My goal was to elevate my proficiency in Python programming and become more effective in delivering quality solutions. I took up challenging projects that helped me expand my knowledge of the language and its modules. To maximize my learning, I proactively troubleshooted issues to the best of my ability before seeking help from peers or supervisors. My dedicated and persistent approach led to significant improvements in my coding abilities and the successful delivery of optimal solutions to complex problems. This experience not only bolstered my Python development skills but also cultivated my independence, time management, and critical thinking abilities. Overall, it was an enriching experience that contributed significantly to my personal and professional growth.</p><br><br>

		            	<p>My aim was to enhance my skills in test creation and develop a better understanding of how to design successful test cases. I sought out opportunities to learn from experienced colleagues and studied previous test cases, carefully analyzing their structure and design to gain insights into best practices. Additionally, I leveraged various resources, such as online tutorials and industry-specific publications, to expand my knowledge and skills. As I progressed, I practiced writing test cases, solicited feedback from peers, and refined my approach to better align with project requirements. I evaluated my progress by examining the success rate of my tests, tracking the reduction of errors and defects, and measuring the overall efficiency of the testing process. The experience helped me gain valuable insights into the software development process and refined my analytical and problem-solving abilities.</p>

			            <p>The goal of improving problem solving skills, both as an individual and as a team member, required a proactive approach. This involved taking on a variety of challenges to develop a deeper understanding of problem-solving techniques and their application. Success was measured by being able to contribute more effectively to team problem-solving efforts, by sharing ideas and approaches, and facilitating the resolution of complex issues. Additionally, personal development was achieved by reducing the frequency of seeking assistance when working independently. Achieving this goal required a commitment to ongoing learning, experimentation, and collaboration, which ultimately fostered greater self-confidence, improved decision-making, and enhanced problem-solving abilities both individually and within a team context.</p>
